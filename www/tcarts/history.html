                            <p>Thiagarajar College, founded on 7th July 1949, was formally inaugurated on 12th October 1949 by His Excellency, the King of Bhavnagar, the then Governor of Madras State. At the inaugural function, the founder, Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar, described this institution as a "small and humble endeavour in education". The college, now has an impressive history covering 65 epoch-making years.</p>
                            <p>From its inception, Thiagarajar College has been one of the premier institutions in Madurai. It started with only three undergraduate courses, but now has grown in stature and offers 19 UG, 13 PG and 9 M.Phil. programmes, in addition to 11 Diploma and 11 Certificate Courses.</p>
                            <p>The college is a private, aided, co-educational institution affiliated to Madurai Kamaraj University. It is meticulously managed by the Kalaithanthai Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar Memorial Trust. The motto of the college is <img src="img/profile-pics/motto.gif"> which means "Wisdom and love embody the divine”.</p>
                             <p>He college has come a very long way from the time of its inception, with the significant contribution of the founder, the great philanthropist Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar, and the committed service and support of the members of his family, the late Dr. Mrs. Radha Thiagarajan (then Emeritus President), Mr. Karumuttu T. Kannan (President) and Dr. Mrs. Uma Kannan (Secretary and Vice President).</p>
                              <p>As well as academic excellence and character development, the focus of the college is to prepare students for the challenges of the highly competitive job market by ensuring that they are employable. It aims at providing quality education, fostering excellence in research and promoting academic inquiry. The college has been recognized as a Research Centre of Excellence since 1978 and was upgraded as an autonomous institution in 1987. It was first accredited Five Stars by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in 2001 and was re-accredited ‘A’ Grade in 2007 and again re-accredited ‘A’ Grade in the third cycle by NAAC in January 2013. The college has completed 27 years as an autonomous institution.</p>
                               <p>The college offers 11 UG, 8 PG, and 4 M.Phil. courses under the aided stream, and 8 UG, 5 PG, 5 M.Phil. 12 Certificate and 11 Diploma Courses in the self-finance stream. (This includes the career oriented programmes offered by 6 departments.) The 8 departments which have been upgraded as Research Centres offer Ph.D. programmes.</p>
                                <p>The curriculum endeavours to integrate the acquisition of knowledge and career skills in the student community. The teaching-learning systems have been further strengthened by nurturing a creative environment so as to inspire out-of-the-box thinking and innovative solutions. The learning process has been made more student-friendly through modern teaching aids and ICT facilities, and accentuated with the students’ participation in project work, on-the-job training, internship, and e-learning. Moreover, in keeping with its aim of imparting a well-rounded education, the college also plays an active role in creating an awareness of our multidimensional heritage and culture.</p>
